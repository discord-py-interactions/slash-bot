**ðŸ”Ž Utilities made easy.**

----

**Astro** is the main bot powering moderation and other utilities in the `interactions.py`_ support server. The goal of Astro is to make searching simple, and automate our moderation process. Whether that's creating tags with autocompleted suggestions, code examples, or interactive tutorials: Astro has you covered. Interactions should be simple to understand, and coding them is no different.

This project is built with **interactions.py** ``4.0.2``, the no. 1 leading Python interactions library that empowers bots with the ability to implement slash commands and components with ease. The codebase of this bot reflects how simple, modular and scalable the library is---staying true to the motto of what it does.
